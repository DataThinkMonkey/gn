A command line interactive menu for Evernote, using Geeknote.

An easy to use interface for Geeknote on the command line to manage EverNote.
I wrote this because I couldn't remember all the Geeknote commands and had to keep looking them up. 
Must have Geeknote installed. See https://github.com/jeffkowalski/geeknote.git.
